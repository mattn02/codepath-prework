## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

This was my first experience getting accustomed to Swift, XCode, and the simulation aspect of the app-creating process. I had lots of fun navigating through the UI and making my ideas come to fruition
